 * Return Keys and Values. Write a program that takes an object and returns an array which contains two arrays: one for the keys of the object and the other for the values of the object.


* Where's Waldo? Create a function that takes a string and returns true if Waldo is found, and false if he's not.

Examples:

isWaldoHere("is there wal here ?") ➞ false
isWaldoHere("I found you Waldo!") ➞ true
isWaldoHere("is wally here?") ➞ false
isWaldoHere("waldo is here") ➞ true

* isPrime? Create a function that returns true if a number is prime and false if it's not. NB: a prime number is any positive integer greater than 1, which is only evenly divisible by two divisors: itself and 1. The first ten prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 and 29.

Examples:

isPrime(7) ➞ true
isPrime(9) ➞ false
isPrime(10) ➞ false


* For the longest word. Create a function to find the longest word in a given string.

i.e. longestWord("this is a web development course") ➞ "development"
